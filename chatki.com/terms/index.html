<p class="sub-title">Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
<p>Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules using the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedures, or, by mutual agreement, the BVI International Arbitration Centre (BVIIAC), as modified by the IAC Procedures for the Administration of Arbitration. This contract shall be interpreted under BVI law, and the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods, which will apply to all matters relating to the use of this Service.</p>
<p class="sub-title">Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Nonindividualized Relief</p>
<p>YOU AND Chatki AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Chatki AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>
<p class="sub-title">Arbitration Procedures</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice describing the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail ("Notice"). The Notice to Chatki should be sent to the Bridgestone International Group, Inc. address provided below. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.</p>
<p>If you and Chatki are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or Chatki may initiate arbitration proceedings with JAMS. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the JAMS website at <a title="JAMS website" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/jamsconnect/">https://www.jamsadr.com/jamsconnect/</a>. In addition to filing this form with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Chatki c/o Bridgestone International Group, Inc. at the following address: Wickhams Cay 1 Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Arbitration shall be conducted online using the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedures. By mutual agreement, the parties to the arbitration may elect to use BVI International Arbitration Centre (BVIIAC), as modified by the IAC Procedures for the Administration of Arbitration, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Chatki may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. In either case, a sole arbitrator shall be appointed, and proceedings shall be conducted in English.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with BVI law and the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Chatki user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p class="sub-title">Costs of Arbitration</p>
<p>In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. If the arbitrator determines a party to be the prevailing party under the circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of its claims and counterclaims, the arbitrator may award the prevailing party an appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration. </p>
<p class="sub-title">Severability</p>
<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in this Section regarding the Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.</p>
<p class="sub-title">Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Chatki prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and Chatki. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on Chatki.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice by email.</p>
